                 # WindowsForm
                 application that will provide functionality to create and save an XML file containing
                 complete hierarchy of files and folders for a specified folder:
                    1. Each folder should be qualified with:
                        a. Folder name
                        b. Folder size (bytes)
                        c. Number of files
                    2. Each file should be qualified with:
                        a. File name
                        b. File size (bytes)
                        c. File creation time
                        d. File last access time
                        e. File last modified time
                    After the XML file is created the application needs to display the entire folder hierarchy tree (by using
                    the TreeView class)
                    When a tree node is selected, the application needs to show the selected folder (or file) details listed
                    above. The details should be shown in the same window but separately from the folder hierarchy tree
